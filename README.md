1. What questions would you have when see that design?
    What can I do to make it more responsive even though just a little? How can I make it as close as the design? What code should I implement?

2. What considerations would you need to take to implement all features seen in design?
    The size, height, width, the margin, the padding and what can I do to make it responsive, also the time spending on it.

3. What obstacles or challenges might you encounter when coding this design?
    Note to self, if you don't want to see your container shrink while you try making it responsive, don't use --this guy--> % <-this guy--

4. How would you implement the design to make similar as the mock up?
    I would always compare it and double/triple check if somethings not right, so I can make it more similar as the mock up.
